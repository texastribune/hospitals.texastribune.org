    Use this application to learn more about the quality of care available at each of Texas' 377 hospitals, and see how your local hospitals compare with one another, as well as with state and national standards. Funded in part by a 12-month grant from the Kaiser Foundation, The Texas Tribune's Hospital Explorer allows you to compare hospitals using data collected and analyzed by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services.
